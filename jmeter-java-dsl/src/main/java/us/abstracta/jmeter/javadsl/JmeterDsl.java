/**
 * This is the main class to be imported from any code using JMeter DSL.
 *
 * This class contains factory methods to create {@link DslTestElement} instances that allow
 * specifying test plans and associated test elements (samplers, thread groups, listeners, etc). If
 * you want to support new test elements, then you either add them here (if they are considered to
 * be part of the core of JMeter), or implement another similar class containing only the specifics
 * of the protocol, repository, or grouping of test elements that you want to build (eg, one might
 * implement an Http2JMeterDsl class with only http2 test elements factory methods).
 *
 * When implement new factory methods consider adding only as parameters the main properties of the
 * test elements (the ones that makes sense to specify in most of the cases). For the rest of
 * parameters (the optional ones), prefer them to be specified as methods of the implemented {@link
 * DslTestElement} for such case, in a similar fashion as Builder Pattern.
